# Lab Prep 3 for Matthew Dalton

1) An interactive reminder. Choose from several options for reminders, set your reminder time, and the display will indicate when time is up.

2) Beat Player. Play a two-two tone melody using the buttons and a speaker will play the results.

3) Weathervane. Display will indicate which direction wind is coming from.

4) Up with the birds. This alarm clock senses the light level in the room and plays an alarm to wake you up in the morning.
